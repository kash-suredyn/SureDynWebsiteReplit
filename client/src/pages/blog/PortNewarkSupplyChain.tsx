              Standing at the edge of Port Newark, watching container ships arrive from Shanghai and Hamburg, it's impossible not to feel the pulse of global commerce. This isn't just any port—it's the gateway that connects New Jersey businesses to every corner of the world. When combined with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central's advanced supply chain capabilities, companies across the Garden State are turning their geographic advantage into competitive dominance.
